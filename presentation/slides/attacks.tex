\subsection{Attack trees}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{An attack tree}

\begin{block}{What is it}
Model describing by what means an \emph{asset} can be attacked.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Goal}
Used to determine and understand threats that may arise.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example}
\includeimage[width=0.8\linewidth,height=6cm]{attack-tree-admin}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Threat agents}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Who are they?}
\begin{itemize}
\item External threats
	\begin{itemize}
	\item internet users
	\item viruses
	\item organized crime
	\end{itemize}
\item Internal threats
	\begin{itemize}
	\item employees
    \item intranet users
    \item administrators
    \end{itemize}
\item Natural threats (disasters)
\item Technical failures
	\begin{itemize}
	\item loss of essential services
		% (example: no electricity)
	\item hardware failure
	\item software failure
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why do they attack?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gain
	\begin{itemize}
	\item financial
	\item information
	\item competition
	\end{itemize}
\item To show off
\item By accident (unintentional)
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Impact}
Threat agents have different skills, resources and different motivations that
may have a different influence on the risk.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Risks and rating}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is a \emph{risk}?}
\begin{quote}
The potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of
an asset or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization. It
is measured in terms of a combination of the probability of occurrence of an
event and its consequence.
\textit{-- Wikipedia}
\end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is a \emph{risk}?}
\[ \text{risk} = \text{likelihood} * \text{impact} \]
\begin{itemize}
\item Likelihood: probability of a successful attack
	\\ Influenced by threat agent skills and vulnerability factors
\item Impact: how much damage the attack causes
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vulnerability factors}
\begin{itemize}
\item ease of discovery
\item ease of exploit
\item awareness
\item intrusion detection
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Impact factors}
\begin{itemize}
\item loss of confidentiality
\item loss of integrity
\item loss of availability
\item loss of accountability
\item financial damage
\item reputation damage
\item privacy violation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Context of web applications}

\subsubsection{Network}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Internet}
\begin{itemize}
\item Applications available on the internet
\item Anyone can access the application
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Anonymity}
No identifier for a web user.
\\ Example: IP address shared by multiple users
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{Architecture of a web application}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A web application}
\includeimage[width=\linewidth,height=6cm]{archi-webapplication}
%- Browser: the client, uses scripting
%- Router: connected to the browser (by WiFi) - LAN
%- Internet: not detailed here - WAN
%- Web Application Firewall, IDS, Load Balancer
%- Application Server: with the contained application
%- Database: where the application stores its data
\end{frame}

%\subsubsection{Points of failure}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Points of failure}
Any component may fail; will the web site continue to work after an attack?
\begin{block}{Single point of failure}
A part of a system that prevents the entire system from working when it fails.
\\ Solution: duplication
\end{block}
\end{frame}
